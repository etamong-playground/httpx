# httpx — cross-app error convention

> **About** — One of several small shared libraries used across a personal "fleet" of small apps (error handling · audit logging · encryption-at-rest · i18n · UI · …). Authored and maintained with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) (Anthropic's agentic CLI). Each README documents the design rationale behind the library.
>
> **This is a public repository** — keep internal infrastructure details (hostnames, secret/Vault paths, private URLs, internal issue/MR references) out of code, comments, and commit messages.

This repo holds the convention in **two stacks** (same contract, same log line):

- **Go** (this README): `go get github.com/etamong-playground/httpx` — see below.
- **TypeScript/JS**: `@etamong-playground/httpx`, published from [`ts/`](ts/) (Node, Cloudflare
  Workers, browser). Use `fail()` server-side and `formatError()` in frontends.

---

The Go library, for Go HTTP services. A handler reports
a failure once; the helper writes a clean, non-leaky `{"error","ref"}` response to the
client **and** logs one structured JSON record server-side under the same 8-hex `ref`.

The `ref` is the **join key** between a user's report and the exact log line: paste it
into a Grafana/Loki dashboard and it resolves across every app. The
log record is JSON so Loki parses it with `| json` and aggregates identically across
services.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/etamong-playground/httpx
```

Public module — no `GOPRIVATE` needed.

## Use

Construct one `Responder` at startup and share it across handlers:

```go
resp := &httpx.Responder{
    Log:  httpx.NewLogger(os.Stdout),                   // JSON, lowercase level
    App:  "pages",                                       // = k8s app / namespace
    User: func(r *http.Request) string {                 // optional caller identity
        return identityFrom(r.Context()).Email
    },
    // Route is optional; defaults to r.Pattern (Go 1.23+) then r.URL.Path.
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if err := doThing(); err != nil {
        resp.Fail(w, r, http.StatusBadRequest, "요청을 처리하지 못했어요.", err)
        return
    }
}
```

`Fail` returns the `ref`. For streaming responses where headers are already flushed,
use `Ref` to log + get a ref without writing a body, then splice it in yourself.

## The contract

Response body (always): `{"error":"<clean localized message>","ref":"<8 hex>"}`.
The raw `err` is **never** sent to the client.

Log record (one JSON line to stdout):

```json
{"time":"…","level":"error","msg":"request failed","app":"pages","ref":"3f9a1c0b","method":"POST","path":"/api/v1/sites/{slug}/deploys","status":400,"user":"alice@example.com","err":"multipart: message too large"}
```

`ref` is a parsed field, **never** a Loki stream label (cardinality). `path` should be
a route template, not the raw URL. Mirror this exact key set in other languages
(`@etamong-playground/httpx` for TS, a `tracing` snippet for Rust) so a quoted ref maps 1:1
to a Loki lookup in any app.

## Request correlation (X-Request-Id)

By default each `Fail`/`Ref` mints its own `ref`, so the error line is the only place
that id appears. Install the `RequestID` middleware to give the **whole request** one
id and thread it through every log line:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
// … register handlers …
srv := httpx.RequestID(accessLog(mux)) // outermost, before access logging
```

`RequestID` reuses a trusted inbound `X-Request-Id` (so the id spans services and the
front proxy) or mints a fresh one, stores it in the request context, and echoes it on
the response as `X-Request-Id`. `Responder.emit` then reuses it as the error `ref`, so
a single id ties together:

- the `X-Request-Id` header the client sees,
- the `access` log line — add `"ref": httpx.ReqID(r.Context())`,
- the `audit` log line — add `"ref": httpx.ReqID(ctx)`,
- the `error` line (automatic).

Read it anywhere downstream with `httpx.ReqID(r.Context())`; it returns `""` when the
middleware isn't installed, and `Fail`/`Ref` then fall back to a fresh per-error ref —
so adopting this is non-breaking. One quoted id now resolves a request's whole
access → audit → error trail in Grafana.
